# Perceptual-Assessment-of-Depth-of-Field-Visualization-in-Light-Field-Displays
This repository contains:
1. Nine Full-Parallax (FP) Densely-Sampled Light Fields (DSLF). Each light field is processed with different low-pass filters which renders depth-of-field (DoF) with various ranges. 
2. Opinion Scores of the participants for the visualized content on the light field display.
3. Code for analyzing the data.
4. Code for quantifying the scenes with DASC model.
5. Code for correlating the value of the DASC model and result of subjective study.
